👨‍💻 About Me
======
I am currently a Year 3 undergraduate student in the Department of Computer Science at [Beijing Normal-Hong Kong Baptist University](https://bnbu.edu.cn/en/). My research interest includes 3D computer vision, machine learning and deep learning.

I am very fortunate to be currently advised by [Dr.Wentao Cheng](https://wtchengcv.github.io/) in 3D computer vision and [Prof.Weifeng Su](https://staff.uic.edu.cn/wfsu/en) in my early research in bioinformatics and biomedical topics.
